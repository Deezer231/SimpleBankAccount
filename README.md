A small Java file I made to mess around with how a basic bank account system might work. It lets you:

-Create an account

-Deposit money

-Withdraw money (as long as thereâ€™s enough in the account)

-Print out the account details

-I did this as a lil side thing to help myself understand Java classes, constructors and methods.

This program allows you to:

-> Create a bank account with a name and balance

-> Deposit money into the account

-> Withdraw money (with a check for sufficient funds)

-> Display the account details
